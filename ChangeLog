Current
- Migrated to be fully automake/autoconf compliant
- Included CXBE source in OpenXDK tree to provide better support for Linux users
- OpenXDK now has working knowledge of what directory it was launched out of.  
  This means that relative paths such as "./blah.txt" will now be picked up from
  the XBE's launched directory, instead of C:\
- Added the XMountDrive() API
- Added XFindFirstFile(), XFindNextFile(), XCloseFile() APIs
- Added support for POSIX dirent APIs - opendir(), readdir(), closedir(), etc
- SDL_Audio is now able to auto-convert the various frequencies, and bits per sample.
- Fixed a malloc bug that prevented allocation of more than 8MB memory
- Changed the video buffer address calculation to support xecuter2 (and other) 
  BIOSes (I hope this is the only change we need for these BIOSes).
- Numerous other small bugfixes
