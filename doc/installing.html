<h1>Installing OpenXDK</h1>
OK... I assume you have decided that the OpenXDK is something you want to install.  Now, the OpenXDK provides a set of
libraries that you can use to develop your application.  Once you have the OpenXDK libraries installed, you can then write your application.  This
page describes the steps required to install the OpenXDK libraries... if you have already done that, there is separate documentation on <a href="developing.html">developing applications</a>.
<p>
You can install the OpenXDK libraries in three ways (in order of preference):
<ol>
<li>Download the binary pre-compiled version from sourceforge as a ZIP file (Win32 users only - sorry!).  This is a convenient
time saving option.</li>
<li>Download the packaged source code as a compressed TAR file.  This is appropriate for both Win32 and Linux users and requires that you 
compile the OpenXDK libraries.</li>
<li>Use CVS to download the latest and greatest version.  While I do try to make sure that only working code gets
checked in, you might sometimes get code that doesn't work if you use this method.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that my development environment is Windows 2000 using the Cygwin development kit.  It worked with MingW on Windows some time ago, but I haven't tested it recently.
I have been endeavouring to give better support for Linux users, also.
<h3>Cygwin</h3>
You will need a pretty recent version of Cygwin.  I don't recall specifically which bits I installed, but I am do know that you will need at least the following packages:
<ul>
<li>gcc</li>
<li>binutils</li>
<li>automake</li>
<li>autoconf</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux</h3>
You will need to download and install a Linux-to-Win32 cross compiler.  The one that I have personally tested is the <code>i386-mingw32</code> 
cross compiler.  I installed the RPMs from <a href="http://bitwalk.hp.infoseek.co.jp/download.html">here</a> and everything just worked fine.

<h2>Binary Pre-Compiled Version</h2>
<p>
This is the easiest of the three options (as long as you are a Win32 user).  Just download the latest binary file from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56780&package_id=52140">Source Forge</a>.  
It will usually be called something like <code>OpenXDK_0_05_bin.zip</code> (depending on the version).  Decide what directory you want the libraries installed in (I personally install it into <code>/usr/local/openxdk</code>, but you can 
put it wherever you want), and unzip it into that directory.  That's it!
You will need to make note of the directory you install it in so that you can set the PATHs correctly when you are developing your own applications.
<p>
Note that the ZIP file already contains the leading <code>openxdk</code> directory, so if you want the binaries to be installed into <code>/usr/local/openxdk</code>, you need
to unzip it into <code>/usr/local</code>.
<h2>Packaged Source</h2>
<p>
Download the latest source file from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56780&package_id=52140">Source Forge</a>.  
It will usually be called something like <code>OpenXDK_0_05_src.tgz</code> (depending on the version).  Decide what directory you want the source to be installed in.  I 
normally use <code>/home/craig/openxdk</code>, but you can put it wherever you like.  
<p>
You then need to decide where you want the OpenXDK libraries to be installed.  I personally put them into <code>/usr/local/openxdk</code>, but you can put them wherever suits.  
The following instructions assume that you untarred the source into <code>/usr/home/openxdk</code> and you want to install into <code>/usr/local/openxdk</code>.  From a BASH 
shell, execute the following commands:
<p>
<b>Cygwin</b>
<pre>
cd /usr/home/openxdk
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openxdk
make all install
</pre>

<b>Linux</b>
<pre>
cd /usr/home/openxdk
export WANT_AUTOCONF=2.5
export WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.6
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openxdk --host=i386-mingw32
make all install
</pre>
 
To check that the installation worked correctly (in both cases), run <code>ls -las /usr/local/openxdk/lib</code>, and you should see something like (file sizes will vary between releases):
<pre>
bash-2.05b$ ls -las /usr/local/openxdk/lib
total 720
   4 drwxrwxrwx+   2 edwardsc None         4096 Sep  8 08:16 .

</pre>
<p>
<h2>CVS HEAD</h2>
<p>
This procedure is almost the same as the Packaged Source installation, except that you are using the latest copy of the code, instead of
the packaged release.  Use CVS to download the HEAD from SourceForge into your source directory, and the follow the instructions in the 
Packaged Source section.
<h2>One last thing...</h2>
As part of the build process, an executable called <code>cxbe</code> will be creating in the <code>bin</code> directory of wherever you installed OpenXDK. 
This directory needs to be in your path (or fully qualified in your application makefile).  See <a href="developing.html">developing applications</a> for more information.
