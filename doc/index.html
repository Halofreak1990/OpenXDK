<h1>OpenXDK - Open XBOX Development Kit</h1>
Welcome to the OpenXDK!!  OpenXDK is a kit for developing applications that will
run on the Microsoft XBOX.  It has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Compilable using a GCC-based toolchain. It now compiles using the Cygwin GCC compiler. Unfortunately, as much 
as it would have been desirable to support both MS and GNU toolchains, the practicalities are such that the MS 
compilers are no longer supported. Sorry! (Although, theoretically, you should be able to compile your 
application using the MS compilers and link in the GCC-compiled OpenXDK libraries.)</li>
<li>It now contains a complete libc replacement (thanks to newlib.) This means that 99% of the normal stdio, 
memory, sprintf, et al routines are available.</li>
<li>Multimedia support is provided using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) and supports video, joysticks and 
event handling. Video is currently limited to 640x480 or smaller. Only one joystick/pad is supported (but that 
is expected to be fixed soon.)</li>
<li>To demonstrate the capabilities of the current OpenXDK framework, the SDL port of Doom (without sound or 
networking) is able to be compiled and executed. You will need to find a DOOM1.WAD (shareware) and put it in 
the root of your XBOX's C drive.</li>
<li>Sound and networking are currently not supported. If you have experience in interfacing with the NVidia 
nForce MCP-D chip at the hardware/driver level, please get involved!</li>
</ul>
