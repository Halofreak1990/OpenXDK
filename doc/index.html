<h1>OpenXDK - Open XBOX Development Kit</h1>
Welcome to the OpenXDK!!  OpenXDK is a kit for developing applications that will
run on the Microsoft XBOX.  It has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Compilable using a GCC-based toolchain. It now compiles using the Cygwin GCC compiler. Unfortunately, as much 
as it would have been desirable to support both MS and GNU toolchains, the practicalities are such that the MS 
compilers are no longer supported. Sorry! (Although, theoretically, you should be able to compile your 
application using the MS compilers and link in the GCC-compiled OpenXDK libraries.)</li>
<li>It now contains a complete libc replacement (thanks to newlib.) This means that 99% of the normal stdio, 
memory, sprintf, et al routines are available.</li>
<li>Multimedia support is provided using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) and supports video, audio, joysticks and 
event handling. Video is currently limited to 640x480 or smaller. Only one joystick/pad is supported (but that 
is expected to be fixed soon.)</li>
<li>To demonstrate the capabilities of the current OpenXDK framework, the SDL port of Doom (without sound or 
networking) is able to be compiled and executed. You will need to find a DOOM1.WAD (shareware) and put it in 
the root of your XBOX's C drive.</li>
<li>Networking is currently not supported. If you have experience in interfacing with the NVidia 
nForce MCP-D chip at the hardware/driver level, please get involved!</li>
<li>Now with both Windows and <b>Linux</b> support!</li>
</ul>

<b>16th December 2004 - Release 0.06</b>
<p>A new version (0.06) of the OpenXDK has just been released. 
<p>The key features in this release are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Support for compiling on both Linux and Windows though migration to automake/autoconf based builds</li>
<li>Enhanced directory handling.  For example, the notion of current directory is now supported, as well as being able to list and navigate through files and directories</li>
<li>Increased audio support.  SDLAudio will now auto-convert the various sample rates and frequencies</li>
<li>Lastly, hopefully a start at supporting the Xecuter (and other debug-based) BIOSes.  Please let me know if you still have troubles with OpenXDK applications on these BIOSes</li>
</ul>
<p>A special thanks to Tom and Ender for their initial feedback and testing of the Linux builds.  Likewise, to xphile for his tireless work converting the build process to automake.
<p>This will be the last update for a few months as I leave very shortly to embark on a 3 month holiday.  However, when I return, I will be concentrating on:
<ul>
<li>SDL support for JPG, GIF, and PNG</li>
<li>MP3 support</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Building a simple demo dashboard - if it hasn't already been done by the time I get back :-)</li>
</ul>

<b>7th November 2004 - Release 0.05</b>
<p>A new version (0.05) of the OpenXDK has just been released. 
<p>The feature that is of most interest is <b>audio support</b>.  Currently, only 
16-bit stereo 44kHz samples are supported, but auto-conversion for other types 
will be supported soon.  The SDL_Audio layer will attempt to convert to something 
playable, but the conversion is still experimental.
<p>In addition to this, OpenXDK also supports SDL_File, SDL_Timer, SDL_Thread, 
SDL_Mutex and SDL_Semaphore.
<p>This release also contains a couple of minor bugfixes to the newlib/libc layer.
<p>A huge thank you to Andy Green (for writing the original Cromwell sound 
layer and answering my ridiculously naive audio questions) and also to the 
guys on the comp.lib.sdl newsgroup for their patience and advice.

<b>13th October 2004 - Xecuter BIOS problems</b>
<p>There are some known problems executing OpenXDK applications on chips that 
have the Xecuter BIOS.  The problem has been around for quite a while (since 2002), but I cannot
find anyone from xecuter that is able to give me any information as to what is 
actually causing the problem.
<p>If you have any information about this, please let me know.

<b>7th October 2004 - Release 0.04.1</b>
<p>Well, I inadvertantly checked in some of the automake/autoconf files that contained some
hardcoded paths to my local workspace.  Sorry!  Please update to the latest build.
<p>I also have added a binary package that contains just the cygwin-precompiled OpenXDK
libraries and header files.  Unzip it into <code>/usr/local</code> and you should be 
able to compile your own programs.
<p>Lastly, I added the ability to launch XBE files using either <code>XLaunchXBE()</code> or 
<code>execve()</code>) APIs.  This gets us much closer to being able to write a dashboard
of some sort.  What is still outstanding is how to get a list of files.  I am investigating
using the POSIX opendir/readdir/etc API to do so (I might also provide an API that 
looks more like the Microsoft <code>FindFirstFile</code>... we'll see!).
